The first commit contains the code which creates the connection between my application and the mysql database, using ORM (Hibernate).
The following commits contains new files and modifications.
Sorry I don't have only source files but i forgot to create a git.ignore file the first two times.

PS: in the documentation i spoke of the package "beans", which in the application is under the name "persistent". What happened is that i thought i could change the name of my package into "beans" but it messed up the hibernate connection and i had to change it back. So the name of the package beans in the documentation actually refers to persistent.
